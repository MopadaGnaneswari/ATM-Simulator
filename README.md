# A program that simulates the all atm functionalities and operations (Check balance,Balance,Withdraw)
An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulator is a system that imitates the functioning of an actual ATM machine. It can be a computer program or a physical device that allows users to practice or test ATM operations. This can be very useful for software testing, training, and demonstration purposes. 

The primary functionalities of an ATM and hence an ATM simulator include:

1. **Card Verification**: To use an ATM, a customer needs to insert their ATM card into the machine. This process is simulated by allowing the user to input the card information, such as the card number.

2. **PIN Verification**: After inserting the card, the user is prompted to enter their Personal Identification Number (PIN) for authentication. The ATM simulator verifies this PIN against the stored data.

3. **Menu Selection**: Once the card and PIN are verified, the user is presented with a menu of options. These typically include checking account balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and sometimes other services such as bill payments or mobile top-ups.

4. **Balance Inquiry**: This operation allows the user to check their account balance. In an ATM simulator, the system retrieves the account balance associated with the card number from its data store.

5. **Withdrawal**: The user can choose to withdraw money from their account. The ATM simulator checks if the account has sufficient funds. If so, it subtracts the desired amount from the stored balance and simulates the dispensing of money. In a physical simulator, this might be represented by a message or sound. In a software simulator, a message indicating the new balance and a successful transaction may be displayed.

6. **Deposit**: In some cases, ATMs and their simulators allow users to deposit money. The system would prompt the user to enter the deposit amount, then add that amount to the stored balance.

7. **Exit/End Session**: After the user has completed their transactions, they can choose to end the session. The simulator will then return to the initial state, ready for the next user.

8. **Receipt Generation**: After every transaction, the ATM offers the user an option to print a receipt. In a simulator, this could be displayed on the screen or saved as a file.

ATM simulators often include error handling for situations like entering an incorrect PIN, trying to withdraw more money than is available in the account, or technical issues with the "machine".
